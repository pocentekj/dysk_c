# dysk C

Because it all started with a C:\

A colorful disk usage viewer for Linux, written in C.  
Shows a table with device, filesystem, total/used/available space, and an ASCII progress bar.  
This is a work in progress and primarily a learning project.

## Status

**Work in progress.**  
Expect bugs, hardcoded columns, and the occasional existential error message.

## Why?

Mainly for learning/practicing C and having fun with terminal UI and Linux internals.  
If you find it useful, thatâ€™s a bonus!
